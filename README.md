## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

# 1. Dataset

*Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.*

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data)we are using is from Kaggle, authored by originally Paul Mooney. It is about famous novel by J.R.R.Tolkien - The Lord of the Rings, and a film series based on the novel. The data originally contains two datasets - first one is about the characters in the novel, and the second is scripts from the three films. 

First dataset contains the following features of characters: *Birth, Death, Gender, Hair, Height, Name, Race, Realm, Spouse*
Second dataset contains dialogs from movies and has 3 columns: *Char, Dialog, Movie*

Additionally, in the context of LOTR, we have found another interesting [source](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Timeline) which includes timeline of events in LOTR world. This site provides multiple tables, each corresponds to one of the six ages - *"Years of the Lamps", "Years of the Trees", and First, Second, Third, and Fourth Age*. The structure of the datasets are almost the same and each has two main columns: *Year, Event*.

# 2. Problematic

*Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop. What am I trying to show with my visualization? Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.*

Our project will illustrate the lifespan of the characters through different Middle-Earth ages, their interactions through the dialogues, analysis of their roles in each movie such as general sentiment, relations with events, and each other's, etc. We will show the links between the characters, how they are close, and if their racial, physical characteristics are relevant in the analysis. 

Additionally, we are planning to show evolution of the events through time in Middle Earth, and their affects on the main characters and consequences in the appropriate movie.
